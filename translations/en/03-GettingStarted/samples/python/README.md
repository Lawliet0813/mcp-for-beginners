# MCP Calculator Server (Python)

A simple implementation of a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server in Python that offers basic calculator functionality.

## Installation

Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or install the MCP Python SDK directly:

```bash
pip install mcp>=1.18.0
```

## Usage

### Running the Server

The server is intended for use with MCP clients (such as Claude Desktop). To start the server:

```bash
python mcp_calculator_server.py
```

**Note**: If you run the server directly in a terminal, you may encounter JSON-RPC validation errors. This is normal behaviorâ€”the server is waiting for properly formatted messages from an MCP client.

### Testing the Functions

To verify that the calculator functions are working correctly:

```bash
python test_calculator.py
```

## Troubleshooting

### Import Errors

If you encounter `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mcp'`, install the MCP Python SDK:

```bash
pip install mcp>=1.18.0
```

### JSON-RPC Errors When Running Directly

Errors like "Invalid JSON: EOF while parsing a value" when running the server directly are expected. The server is designed to process messages from MCP clients, not direct input from the terminal.
